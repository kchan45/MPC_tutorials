# MPC Tutorials using CasADi

Tutorials on various model predictive control (MPC) implementations. Created for the Mesbah Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

This repository contains example code in MATLAB and (soon) Python implementations of MPC. The optimization problems are formulated using [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/), which has both MATLAB and Python interfaces. Thus, implementation in one language can easily be transferred to the other language, assuming you are familiar with the syntax of both languages. E.g., a common change is that Python utilizes zero-indexing (indexing variables start at 0) versus MATLAB uses one-indexing (indexing variables start at 1).
