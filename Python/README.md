# Python MPC Tutorials using CasADi

Tutorials on various model predictive control (MPC) implementations in Python. Created for the Mesbah Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

**This folder is a work-in-progress**

* A general MPC tutorial is given as a Google Colab notebook: `mpc_demo.ipynb` (Note that this particular version is verified to work in Google Colab and may need minor modifications to work as a standard Jupyter notebook.)
* However, Python implementations of MPC using CasADi that is similar to the MATLAB implementations can be found as a part of this repository: https://github.com/kchan45/BO4Policy_Search_Plasma
